Develop a Java Based Solution to Minimize Scheduling Conflicts

5 Time Slots 
5 Classrooms (16 max)
Sessions Cannot Run more than Twice
Student May Not Repeat a Session
You may cean up data tables, but do not change student choices
 

Schedule a Student for 5 Session (giving as many of their choices as possible)

**Goal / Objective...

     To design and code an algorithm that:

generates a schedule for the students, given structure above, with the fewest number of conflicts
Your code should describe your approach, explaining choices about conflicts
Outputs should include a roster for each session, and a master roster by student
Participation grades for time on task in class
Daily github commits are expected (for each class day minimum)
Submission is GitHub folder with all files needed to run/execute your program.
